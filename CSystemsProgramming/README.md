# C Systems Programming Projects

A collection of low-level C programs demonstrating system calls, process management, and file I/O.  
These projects highlight experience with **UNIX/Linux system programming** concepts, including building custom shells, handling processes, and working with files.

---

## Project List
- **ModifiedShell.c** – Custom shell with support for running commands and basic process management  
- **PipingShell.c** – Extended shell implementation supporting pipes (`|`) for inter-process communication  
- **FileStats.c** – Utility program that computes statistics (line, word, and character counts) for input files  
- **Gradebook.c** – File-based grade management system for storing and calculating student performance

## How to Compile & Run
Use `gcc` to compile any program:  

```bash
gcc ModifiedShell.c -o shell
./shell
