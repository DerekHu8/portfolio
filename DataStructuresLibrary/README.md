# Data Structures Library

Custom Java implementations of fundamental data structures and algorithms.  
Built from scratch to demonstrate **time complexity, memory management, and practical use cases**.

## Contents
- `ArrayStack.java` – Stack with array backing
- `CircularQueue.java` – Queue with circular buffer
- `HashChaining.java` – Hash table with chaining
- `HashProbing.java` – Hash table with linear/quadratic probing
- `DoublyLinkedList.java` – Doubly linked list implementation
- `BalancedBST.java` – Balanced binary search tree with rotations
- `ArrayHeap.java` – Heap for priority queue operations

## How to Run
```bash
javac src/*.java
java src.BalancedBST
